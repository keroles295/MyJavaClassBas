	// OOP (object oriented programming):
	// it is just a way of writing code and classes and objects are the basics parts of this method.
	//Why we should to learn OOP?
	//1) because OOP simplifies the development
	//2)it makes it easy to manage and maintain larg problems
	//3)it builds around objects classes and many other things which can help us
	// translate real life objects into computers
	// how to write programming using OOP
	//1) create classes inside classes define properties/fields/ attributes to translate 
	//how an object from real life looks like.
	//2)create methods/behaviors/functions to define how that thing works in real life.
	//-- Note:
	//OOP is also supported in many other programming language like c#, PHP, Python, Javascript
	//other than OOP we also have different paradigm or ways of writing code functional 
	//programming is one of it also have procedural programing.
	//How do we create a class and its object:
	//class Human{
	//String name;
	//int age;
	//double weight;
	//char gender;
	//void walk(){syso("I can walk");} //methodes/functions/behaviours
	//}
	//public static void main(String[] args){
	//Human Pito=new Human();
	//pito.name="Pito Botros";
	//pito.age='3';
	//pito.weight=35;
	//pito.gender='M';
	//pito.walk();
	//}
	// Rules:
	//1) we can define the fields and methods anywhere in the class.
	//2) The sequence of execution only matters when we are inside a method
